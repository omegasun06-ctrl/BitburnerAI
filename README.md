# 🧠 Bitburner + Copilot: Vibe Coding Journey

Welcome to the **BitburnerAI** repository! This repo is a personal coding playground where I explore and grow my **vibe coding skills** using **Bitburner** and **GitHub Copilot**. All scripts and tools here are generated through interactive sessions with the **Bitburner JavaScript Expert Agent**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Master **Bitburner scripting** to automate and optimize in-game progress.
- Use **GitHub Copilot** to enhance coding fluency and creativity.
- Build a personal library of reusable, well-documented scripts.
- Learn by doing — through experimentation, iteration, and gameplay-driven development.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- Bitburner automation scripts (hacking, growing, weakening, etc.)
- Strategy tools for server mapping, income optimization, and faction progression.
- VS Code integration tips and setup guides.
- Copilot-assisted code snippets and refactors.

## 🚀 Setup Guidance

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omegasun06-ctrl/BitburnerAI.git
